                        </p>
                        <p class="info">I currently work in Nike's Data & Analytics department as a Lead Data Engineer. My team oversees the development and maintenance of data systems and pipelines focused on Nike's market competitors macroforecasting, competitor and Nike reviews, and consumer survey responses.
                        <br>
                        Prior to joining Nike, I pursued dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematics & Computer Science and Political Science at the University of Oregon.
                        <br>
                        Since graduating, I have diversified my skill set through roles in supply chain analytics, financial security and and compliance, and, now, data engineering.
                        <br>
                        Outside of my professional pursuits, I spend my time reading, hiking, and swimming.</p>
